# Recipes
A simple Recipes web app with CRUD functions on MySQL database

Instruction to view website:
Open welcome.php file to view all functionalities of the website.

What's changed from our deliverables:
- Type attribute from Ingredient entity was removed since it was not needed
- List entity was removed as the functionality strayed from the purpose of our application
- Weak entity RecipeIcon was added as we wanted recipes to be able to have an image
- UserSearchesRecipes table was removed as we don't have to store keywords every time a user searches for a recipe
- ResetUserPassword table was removed as the functionality strayed from the purpose of our application
- SendNotifTo table was removed as the functionality strayed from the purpose of our application
- Bookkeeper manages Book User relation and table was added as we redefined the job of BookKeepers
